# 📚 Chapter 6: Resources, Checklists & Reference Templates

## 🎯 Chapter Overview

The previous chapters covered:

```text
Chapter 1 → What are Skills?
Chapter 2 → How do we design Skills?
Chapter 3 → How do we test Skills?
Chapter 4 → How do we distribute Skills?
Chapter 5 → How do we architect and troubleshoot Skills?
```

Chapter 6 turns those concepts into **practical engineering resources**.

It provides:

* production checklists
* Skill structure references
* YAML examples
* implementation templates
* case-study architecture
* testing checklists
* security checks
* release checklists
* interview revision material

The goal is simple:

> **By the end of this chapter, you should be able to start a Skill project without designing everything from scratch.**

# 1. 🌐 Official Resources

When working with Skills, always distinguish between:

1. **The open Agent Skills specification**
2. **Anthropic's implementation**
3. **Your specific agent runtime**
4. **Third-party tooling**

These can have different capabilities and requirements.

### Important resources

| Resource                    | Purpose                                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Agent Skills specification  | Understand the open Skill format          |
| Anthropic Skills repository | Study real Skill implementations          |
| Anthropic API documentation | Programmatic integration                  |
| MCP specification           | Understand tool/resource interoperability |
| Claude Code documentation   | Repository/local agent workflows          |
| Agent SDK documentation     | Build custom agent applications           |

For current implementation details, always check the documentation for the specific runtime you are targeting rather than assuming every Skill feature works identically everywhere.

# 2. 🗂️ Reference A — Complete Pre-Flight Checklist

Before releasing a Skill, walk through every phase.

```mermaid id="9n0xqb"
flowchart LR

    A["Planning"] --> B["Development"]
    B --> C["Validation"]
    C --> D["Security"]
    D --> E["Packaging"]
    E --> F["Release"]
    F --> G["Monitoring"]
    G --> H["Iteration"]
```

---

# 3. 🧠 Phase 1 — Planning & Design

### Problem Definition

* [ ] Have I clearly defined the problem?
* [ ] Is the desired outcome measurable?
* [ ] Have I identified the target users?
* [ ] Have I defined the Skill's boundaries?

### Use Cases

* [ ] Identified 2–3 concrete initial workflows.
* [ ] Defined positive use cases.
* [ ] Defined cases where the Skill should **not** activate.
* [ ] Identified required inputs.
* [ ] Defined expected outputs.

### Tool Mapping

* [ ] Identified required MCP tools.
* [ ] Identified built-in tools.
* [ ] Identified scripts.
* [ ] Identified external APIs.
* [ ] Determined which operations require user confirmation.

### Progressive Disclosure

* [ ] Core workflow fits in `SKILL.md`.
* [ ] Detailed documentation is moved to `references/`.
* [ ] Deterministic operations are implemented in `scripts/`.
* [ ] Reusable files are stored in `assets/`.

---

# 4. 📁 Phase 2 — File Structure

A typical Skill:

```text
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md
├── scripts/
│   ├── validate.py
│   └── process.py
├── references/
│   ├── api.md
│   └── troubleshooting.md
└── assets/
    └── template.json
```

### Checklist

* [ ] Skill directory has a clear name.
* [ ] `SKILL.md` exists.
* [ ] `SKILL.md` uses the correct capitalization.
* [ ] Frontmatter is valid YAML.
* [ ] `name` follows the target specification.
* [ ] `description` clearly describes purpose and scope.
* [ ] Scripts are organized under `scripts/`.
* [ ] Supporting documentation is organized under `references/`.
* [ ] Reusable resources are organized under `assets/`.
* [ ] No unnecessary files are included.

### Important

Do not memorize implementation-specific rules such as:

> "Every Skill must never contain a README."

Instead, distinguish:

```text
Skill package
    ↓
SKILL.md = agent-facing instructions

Repository
    ↓
README.md = human-facing documentation
```

A repository can therefore have:

```text
repository/
├── README.md
└── skill/
    └── SKILL.md
```

---

# 5. 📝 Phase 3 — `SKILL.md` Validation

Check the frontmatter:

```text
✓ Valid YAML
✓ Correct delimiters
✓ Required metadata present
✓ Valid Skill name
✓ Clear description
✓ No accidental secrets
```

Then inspect the body:

```text
✓ Purpose
✓ When to use
✓ Inputs
✓ Workflow
✓ Validation
✓ Error handling
✓ Output
```

A good Skill should allow another developer to answer:

> "What happens from the moment the Skill is activated until the final result?"

---

# 6. 🎯 Phase 4 — Trigger Testing

Test more than one exact phrase.

### Positive tests

```text
"Create a payment subscription."
"Set up a new billing plan."
"Configure the payment gateway."
"Add an enterprise subscription."
```

### Negative tests

```text
"What is a payment gateway?"
"Explain subscription pricing."
"Calculate my tax."
```

The Skill should activate when appropriate and remain inactive when outside its scope.

---

# 7. 🧪 Phase 5 — Functional Testing

Test:

### Happy path

```text
Valid input
    ↓
Skill
    ↓
Tools
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Success
```

### Missing input

```text
Missing parameter
    ↓
Skill identifies missing data
    ↓
Ask user
```

### Tool failure

```text
Tool fails
    ↓
Skill detects failure
    ↓
Recovery / retry / report
```

### Invalid result

```text
Tool returns unexpected data
    ↓
Validation fails
    ↓
Do not continue blindly
```

---

# 8. 📊 Phase 6 — Performance Testing

Measure things that matter for your workflow.

Possible metrics:

| Metric              | Question                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Trigger accuracy    | Does the correct Skill activate?           |
| Workflow completion | Does the task finish successfully?         |
| Tool calls          | Are calls necessary?                       |
| Failed calls        | How often do operations fail?              |
| Token usage         | Is unnecessary context loaded?             |
| Runtime             | Is execution acceptably fast?              |
| User turns          | Does the user need repeated clarification? |
| Recovery rate       | Can failures be recovered safely?          |

Do not optimize for:

> **"Minimum number of tool calls at all costs."**

A workflow with 6 well-validated calls can be better than one with 3 calls that frequently produces incorrect results.

---

# 9. 🔐 Phase 7 — Security Checklist

Before production:

* [ ] No API keys in `SKILL.md`.
* [ ] No passwords in scripts.
* [ ] No private credentials in assets.
* [ ] External inputs are treated as untrusted.
* [ ] Prompt-injection scenarios are tested.
* [ ] Shell commands are reviewed.
* [ ] Tool permissions follow least privilege.
* [ ] Destructive operations have appropriate confirmation.
* [ ] Logs do not expose secrets.
* [ ] Third-party dependencies are reviewed.

Security should be considered part of the Skill architecture, not an afterthought.

---

# 10. 📦 Phase 8 — Packaging & Release

Before publishing:

* [ ] Remove temporary files.
* [ ] Remove debug output.
* [ ] Remove secrets.
* [ ] Verify required files.
* [ ] Verify scripts.
* [ ] Verify references.
* [ ] Run the complete test suite.
* [ ] Update version information where your implementation uses it.
* [ ] Update changelog.
* [ ] Package the Skill using the target platform's supported mechanism.

---

# 11. 📈 Phase 9 — Post-Release Monitoring

After release, monitor:

```text
Undertriggering
Overtriggering
Tool failures
Instruction-following failures
Unexpected outputs
Latency
User feedback
Security issues
```

Then:

```mermaid id="kq3e0v"
flowchart LR

    RELEASE["Release"]

    RELEASE --> MON["Monitor"]
    MON --> BUG["Identify Failure"]
    BUG --> FIX["Improve Skill"]
    FIX --> TEST["Regression Test"]
    TEST --> RELEASE
```

This makes Skill development an iterative engineering process.

---

# 12. ⚙️ Reference B — YAML Frontmatter

The frontmatter is the metadata layer of the Skill.

A generic example:

```yaml
---
name: payflow-payment-gateway

description: >
  Manages customer onboarding, subscription creation,
  and payment-method validation through the PayFlow
  workflow. Use when the user asks to configure payment
  integration, create subscriptions, or onboard a
  payment customer.

license: MIT

compatibility: >
  Requires Python 3.10+ and access to the required
  payment integration environment.

metadata:
  author: DevRel Team
  version: 1.2.0
  category: fintech
  tags:
    - payments
    - billing
    - subscriptions
---
```

### Important distinction

Not every field in this example should be treated as universally required.

The exact supported metadata fields depend on the **Agent Skills specification and runtime implementation**.

Conceptually:

```text
Required / standard metadata
        ↓
name
description

Implementation-dependent metadata
        ↓
license
compatibility
metadata
allowed-tools
custom fields
```

Always validate against the runtime you are targeting.

---

# 13. 🏷️ Designing the `name`

The name should be:

* concise
* descriptive
* predictable
* consistent with the target specification

Examples:

```text
payment-gateway
database-migration
react-native-review
security-audit
report-generator
```

Avoid unnecessarily vague names:

```text
helper
assistant
tool
my-skill
stuff
```

A developer should understand the Skill's purpose from the name.

---

# 14. 🎯 Designing the `description`

The description serves two purposes:

```text
WHAT does this Skill do?
+
WHEN should it be considered?
```

### Weak

```yaml
description: Helps with payments.
```

### Better

```yaml
description: >
  Helps configure payment products, subscriptions,
  and payment gateway integrations. Use when the
  user asks to create or modify payment configuration.
```

### Even better

Define boundaries where useful:

```yaml
description: >
  Helps implement payment gateway integrations,
  subscriptions, and payment configuration.
  Use for implementation and configuration tasks,
  not for general financial education or accounting.
```

The goal is not to stuff every possible keyword into the description.

The goal is to make the Skill's scope **clear and discriminative**.

---

# 16. 🔍 Step 1 — Define the Problem

User request:

> "Set up a payment gateway for a new client."

We first define the desired outcome.

```text
Input:
- client information
- payment provider
- plan configuration

Output:
- validated configuration
- created resources
- identifiers
- verification result
```

---

# 17. 🧱 Step 2 — Define the Workflow

```text
1. Validate client information.
2. Inspect existing configuration.
3. Read required payment-provider rules.
4. Create required payment resources.
5. Validate returned IDs.
6. Verify configuration.
7. Generate final summary.
```

# 18. 📝 Step 3 — Create `SKILL.md`

```markdown
---
name: pay-skill

  Helps configure payment gateway integrations,
  products, subscriptions, and payment methods.
  Use when the user asks to implement or configure
  payment workflows.

---

# Payment Gateway Skill

## Purpose

Configure payment resources using the approved
payment workflow.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Validate Input

Verify:

- customer information
- payment provider
- product configuration
- required credentials

Do not execute external mutations when required
input is missing.

### Step 2 — Inspect Existing State

Check whether the requested resource already exists.

Avoid creating duplicates.

### Step 3 — Create Resources

Use the appropriate payment integration tool.

### Step 4 — Validate

Verify that the API returned valid resource IDs.

### Step 5 — Final Verification

Confirm the created resource exists and has the
expected status.

### Step 6 — Report

Return:

- created resources
- identifiers
- status
- warnings
- failures
```

---

# 19. 🐍 Step 4 — Deterministic Script

Example:

```python
import json
import sys

def validate_payment_config(path):
    with open(path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        config = json.load(f)

    required = [
        "customer_id",
        "amount",
        "currency"
    ]

    missing = [
        field for field in required
        if field not in config
    ]

    if missing:
        return {
            "valid": False,
            "errors": [
                f"Missing field: {field}"
                for field in missing
            ]
        }

    if config["amount"] <= 0:
        return {
            "valid": False,
            "errors": ["Amount must be greater than zero"]
        }

    return {
        "valid": True,
        "errors": []
    }


if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = validate_payment_config(sys.argv[1])
    print(json.dumps(result))
```

The agent can invoke:

```bash
python scripts/validate_payment.py payment.json
```

This keeps exact validation logic outside natural-language reasoning.

---

# 20. 📚 Step 5 — Add References

Suppose payment rules are large.

Do not put everything into `SKILL.md`.

Create:

```text
references/
└── payment-methods.md
```

Example:

```markdown
# Payment Methods

## Card

Required fields:

- card token
- customer ID

## Bank Transfer

Required:

- bank account reference
- currency

## Subscription

Required:

- customer ID
- product ID
- price ID
```

The Skill can load this information when required.

---

# 21. 🔄 Complete Execution

The final workflow becomes:

```mermaid id="n7mb9x"

````

Example:

```markdown
# Test: Missing Customer ID

## Input

Create a subscription for the customer.

## Expected

The Skill should identify that the customer
identifier is unavailable and request the
required information.

## Must Not

The Skill must not invent a customer ID.
```

# 24. 🛡️ Reference F — Security Checklist

Before publishing:

```text
[ ] No API keys
[ ] No passwords
[ ] No access tokens
[ ] No private certificates
[ ] No production database credentials
[ ] No hard-coded secrets
[ ] Shell commands reviewed
[ ] External inputs treated as untrusted
[ ] Tool permissions minimized
[ ] Destructive actions controlled
[ ] Logs sanitized
[ ] Dependencies reviewed
```

A simple rule:

> **If you would not commit it to a public Git repository, do not put it inside a distributable Skill.**

For private Skills, secrets still should not be embedded directly; use the environment's secret-management mechanism.

# 29. 🎤 Final Interview Questions

## What is the minimum conceptual structure of a Skill?

A Skill consists of a defined capability with instructions and metadata, commonly centered around `SKILL.md`, with optional supporting scripts, references, and assets.

---

## Why use progressive disclosure?

To avoid putting every piece of Skill information into the agent's active context at once.

Instead:

```text
Metadata
   ↓
Core instructions
   ↓
Detailed resources
```

Only the information needed for the current task is loaded or consulted.

---

## What should be inside `SKILL.md`?

Primarily:

```text
Purpose
Scope
Workflow
Inputs
Validation
Tool guidance
Error handling
Output expectations
```

Large supporting material should generally be separated into appropriate reference files.

---

## Why use scripts?

For operations where exact, repeatable behavior is preferable:

```text
Validation
Calculations
File processing
Schema checking
Static analysis
Formatting
```

---

## Why use MCP with Skills?

Because they solve different problems:

```text
Skill
↓
How should the task be performed?

MCP
↓
What external capabilities are available?

Tool
↓
What action can actually be executed?
```

---

## How should a Skill handle failure?

A production Skill should define:

```text
Detect
 ↓
Validate
 ↓
Retry when safe
 ↓
Recover / compensate when appropriate
 ↓
Report actual state
```

Never claim success merely because an operation was attempted.

### Five architectural patterns

```text
1. Sequential Workflow
2. Multi-MCP Coordination
3. Iterative Refinement
4. Context-Aware Tool Selection
5. Domain Governance
```

### Five reliability principles

```text
1. Validate intermediate state.
2. Separate policy from execution.
3. Make critical operations explicit.
4. Use deterministic code where appropriate.
5. Design for failure and partial completion.

# 🏁 Final Takeaway

The most important lesson from the complete series is that an Agent Skill is **not simply a large prompt**.

A production Skill is closer to a small software component:

```text
Instructions
+
Workflow
+
Domain Knowledge
+
Tools
+
Deterministic Logic
+
Validation
+
Error Handling
+
Security
+
Versioning
```

The strongest architecture is therefore:

> **Skill defines the procedure → MCP exposes capabilities → tools perform actions → scripts handle deterministic logic → validation checks state → recovery handles failure → versioning and testing make the capability maintainable.**

That is the foundation for building reusable, composable, production-oriented agent capabilities.
